# Product Key Console Application

This project is a **Java-based console application** designed for educational purposes, showcasing key programming concepts and tools. The application allows users to manage software product keys, focusing on object-oriented design principles, file management, and user interaction through the console.

## Purpose

This project was built to demonstrate and enhance my knowledge of Java and its features, especially in the context of **software engineering** and **application design**.

## Technologies, Concepts, and Features

### **Java 11+ Features**
- **Interfaces**: Used to define a common structure for product key operations. This promotes flexibility by allowing different implementations of product key management.
- **Sealed Classes**: Used to restrict which classes can extend or implement the base classes, ensuring a controlled class hierarchy.
- **Polymorphism**: Applied to allow for flexible method behavior, enabling the same method to work on objects of different types.
- **Inheritance**: Ensures reusability of code by allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another.
- **Encapsulation**: Implemented to protect the data (like product keys) by controlling access through getter and setter methods.
- **Exception Handling**: Managed runtime errors gracefully, especially for scenarios like invalid product key formats or file I/O issues.

### **File Handling**
- The application uses **Java I/O** (Input/Output) to read from and write to files, allowing product keys to be stored persistently. This showcases real-world file management capabilities in Java.

### **Collections Framework**
- **Lists** and **Maps** from the Java Collections Framework are utilized to store product keys in memory, demonstrating efficient data handling and retrieval.

### **Maven**:
- Used as a build and dependency management tool. The `pom.xml` file defines the projectâ€™s dependencies and ensures smooth builds.

### **Modularization**
- The application follows a **modular structure**, dividing the code into different classes and packages to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### **Version Control (Git)**
- The project is managed using **Git**, with all source control operations (commits, branches) tracked via this repository.

## Key Features
- **Add Product Keys**: Users can input and store new software product keys.
- **Validate Product Keys**: The system checks the validity of entered product keys.
- **Persistent Storage**: Product keys can be stored in files for later retrieval.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MostafaOsmanFathi/ProductKeyConosl.git

## Learning Outcomes
### This project helped me solidify my understanding of:

1. Java programming concepts: Interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling.
2. Object-oriented design: Writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.
3. File and data handling: Implementing data persistence using Java I/O.
4. Project management with Maven: Automating the build process and managing dependencies.
5. Version control with Git: Collaborating on and tracking changes in code using GitHub.
